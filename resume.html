	<p><strong>Master's Degree</strong> &ndash; <strong>Alcorn State University</strong></p>
	<p>Major: Computer and Information Science GPA: 3.54 &ndash; December 08, 2017</p>
	<p><strong>Bachelor's Degree</strong> &ndash; <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University</strong></p>
	<p>Major: Electronics and Communications Engineering</p>
							
							<p><strong>WORK EXPERIENCE &amp; PROJECTS</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Work: Engineer I, IT Network</strong> &ndash; <strong>Nexstar Media Group, Inc.</strong> &ndash; August 2017 to Current</p>
	<p>Working with Corporate Engineering/IT team to build and administer WJTV/WHLT's IT infrastructure including TCP/IP, LAN, CUCM, various broadcast systems and all associated network configurations and various system interfaces.</p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8226; Maintain Broadcast/TV Engineering automation systems by Florical, video/graphics playout systems by Grass Valley like K2 Summit, Stratus, Ignite Katalyst, Vertigo XG, ChyronHego graphics playout, NewsTicker, Non-Linear Editing Systems with Adobe CC, Edius, and AP ENPS, TVU bonded cellular video transmission systems along all related hardware as well as software interfaces.</li>
	<li>&#8226; Active Directory, Domain Controllers, Firewalls, Routers, Switches, DHCP, DNS, and NAT configurations.</li>
	<li>&#8226; Harris Transmitters, NetVx Encoders, EAS, Harmonic Products, DAS, Nevion Products, SD, HD and 4K over IP transmission. </li>
	<li>&#8226; Had the opportunity to come up with plans to modify, migrate and update various critical systems, networks, and software/applications for more efficient workflow, currently I am in the phase of implementing and executing them.</li>
	<li>&#8226; Maintain various types of storage systems with secured group access for critical business data, and their backups.</li>
	<li>&#8226; Documenting the information for IT department.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&#8226; Purchasing, deployment, and maintenance of computing and networking hardware and software.</li>
</ul>
	<p><strong>Work: Research Assistant</strong> &ndash; <strong>Alcorn State University</strong></p>
	<p>Worked as a research assistant to the chairperson of the Computer Science and Mathematics department to specialize in Genetic Algorithms and topics like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). As a result, to develop a computer application for the Biological department powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8226; Design the initialization and evaluation phases for the search engine's Genetic Algorithm</li>
	<li>&#8226; Worked with Object-Oriented Design, Data Structures, and Algorithms in C++</li>
	<li>&#8226; Participate in professor assignments</li>
</ul>
	<p><strong>Project: Artificial Intelligence Application for Biological Sciences Curriculum Development</strong></p>
	<p>This project has been jointly developed by the departments of Biology and Computer Science at Alcorn State University funded by the Mississippi IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE).</p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8226; The application helps to automate various tasks on their database like to make a quick sort, find maximum and minimum values, search and in result to develop new courses</li>
	<li>&#8226; Developed the Genetic Algorithm to interface with the search box in C++ using the famous traveling salesman solution</li>
</ul>
	<p><strong>Project: Personal Digital Library</strong></p>
	<p>A web application developed to get credit for a Software Engineering course during my master’s program and further to exercise the Agile Methodology during the semester. This assists its users in their day-to-day task management as a student and to keep up with events like assignment due dates, friend’s birthdays. It also helps managing group studies, bookmark various books, research papers, and add contacts.</p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8226; Worked with Microsoft Visio for design and development of the application</li>
	<li>&#8226; Microsoft SQL Server for the database</li>
	<li>&#8226; Used ASP.NET as the programming language and framework to develop the application</li>
</ul>
	<p><strong>Project: Route Clearance System for Emergency Vehicles Using GPS and RFID</strong></p>
	<p>An approach designed to propose and overcome the common limitation of modern road traffic lights which make an emergency vehicle to slow-speed/stop. We used communication devices GPS and RFID technologies that are low cost and the range can be extended up to 500 meters, which is the most useful asset of this project.</p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8226; Every emergency vehicle is fitted with a unique RFID tag (like most toll tags) and the receivers located 500 meters away from the actual traffic junction on every lane sends out an interrupt in a private channel. This interrupt is received by the junction and is set to issue a “Prepare to Stop (Yellow)” in all the lanes except the lane in which the emergency vehicle is approaching to turn it to Green</li>
	<li>&#8226; There are various parameters worked out using GPS to confirm the location of the receiver which further extends to confirm the lane that needs to turn Green</li>
	<li>&#8226; Programmed the microcontroller AT89S52 in C</li>
	<li>&#8226; Developed the interface between RFID receiver module and Micro-controller</li>
</ul>

							<p><strong>ACTIVITIES &amp; ASSOCIATIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8226; Presented at Mississippi Academy of Sciences 81st Meeting, Math, Computer Science and Statistics</li>
